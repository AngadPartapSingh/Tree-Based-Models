# Tree-Based Machine Learning Models
Tree-based ML model (Decision Tree & Random Forest) are applied on a small dataset.
Its a Low-Dimensional dataset.
As our outcome is continuous in nature, we have followed the Regression approach.
Hypertuning, Data standardization and EDA are all well-explained along with the code.
The comparison between Decision Tree and Random Forest is done so as to be sure which model is a best fit for our data.
A pipeline is created for the future unseen data.
Bias-Variance Tradeoff well explained
GridSearchCV implemented for best hyperparameters selection for our model.
